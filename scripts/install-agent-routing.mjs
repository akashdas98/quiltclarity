independent axes for the initial route: model choice addresses capability profile
and ceiling, while effort addresses inference/search/verification depth within that
model. Record separate demand rationales and acceptance checks; reassess either
axis independently at meaningful handoffs. Work class is descriptive, not an
allocation ladder. Before spawning, use the structured routing contract in
\`scripts/agent-routing/README.md\`. Automatically select useful
installed skills/tools; discover missing capabilities only for a concrete need.
Task-justified installation from a reviewed, pinned trusted source is authorized
within existing permissions; account consent and expanded access still require
their actual approval. Preserve stronger capabilities when evidence warrants them.
The local hook is a guardrail, not protected parent/spending enforcement; never
claim complete governance or measured savings from its presence. Checkpoint durable
state after meaningful changes and recommend /clear only after declared lifecycle
readiness; only the user invokes /clear.`;
